            The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> Publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks
            like the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>book</a> and <a
                href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good
            for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes
            written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this
            classic of
            American literature.
